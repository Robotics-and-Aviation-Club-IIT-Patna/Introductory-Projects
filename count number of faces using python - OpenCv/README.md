# Count Number of Faces Using Python and OpenCV

This Python script utilizes the OpenCV library to count the number of faces in an image and draw rectangles around the detected faces.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- OpenCV library
- Pre-trained Haar cascade classifier XML file for face detection

## Usage

1. The script will display the number of faces detected in the image and draw rectangles around the detected faces.

## File Description

- `count_faces.py`: Python script for detecting and counting faces in an image using OpenCV.
- `sample2.webp`: Sample image file used for testing face detection.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV (cv2): Library for computer vision tasks.
- Haar cascade XML file: Pre-trained classifier for detecting faces.

## Result

- Input image
  ![Input Image]( count number of faces using python - OpenCv\sample2.webp)

- Output image

![Output Image](count number of faces using python - OpenCv\sampleoutput.png)

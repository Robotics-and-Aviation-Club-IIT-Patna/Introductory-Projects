Introduction Of This Program
->This program is basically a webcam-based barcode scanner program that leverages the capabilities of common webcams found in most computers, providing a versatile and user-friendly tool for various applications.

Dependencies
->The main dependencies for the program are:-
OpenCV(Open sourceComputer Vision Library):- OpenCV is a popular open-source computer vision library that provides tools for image and video processing. In this program, it is used for capturing video frames from the webcam, image processing, and displaying the results.

ZBar:- ZBar is a barcode and QR code scanning library. It allows the program to decode barcodes from the webcam feed.

How does it work?
->The program captures the webcam feed, processes the images using computer vision techniques, and decodes barcode information using the ZBar library. Real-time feedback is provided, displaying the scanned barcode data on the screen.

Benefits
->Cost Effective, Accessibility, Versatile, User-Friendly, Customizable.

What can be made better?
